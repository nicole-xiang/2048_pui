Welcome to 2048! There are two versions of this game: classic and pokemon! You can  play/pause music by clicking on the play/pause button on the bottom of the screen, as well as adjusting the volume by clicking on the right two buttons. 

Don't know how to play? No worries - go to the instructions page by clicking on the button under the game board. Have fun!! 

Note: When you first load the game, it will take a few seconds to load all asset files (images & music) due to the size.
